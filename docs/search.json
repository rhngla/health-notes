There are 3 main components for this: cardiovascular-, resistance-, and plyometric training."

Managing the within-session training variables is crucial, and so is timing between sessions. Setting training variables too aggressively can lead to breakdowns (e.g.¬†injuries), but setting them too conservatively can end up being inadequate for inducing appreciable physiological adaptations. Too much time between sessions can prevent accumulation of beneficial adaptations, whereas too little time prevents recovery. Figure adapted from (Furrer, Hawley, and Handschin 2023)."

    "text": "1 Cardio-vascular training (CVT)\nWalking, running, cycling, swimming, stair-climbing, and cross-country skiing, ski-ergs, rowing etc. are all activities that can be used for cardiovascular training (CVT). Intensity and duration of activities are key training variables. In my opinion, the qualitative way of specifying these in Table¬†1 is a reasonable level of detail in the context of CVT for those starting out. Quantitative measurements (e.g.¬†with heart rate monitors, blood lactate measurements, VO2max tests etc.) have their place, but are not a pre-requisite for an effective plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession\nIntensity\nDuration\n\n\n\n\nA\nHigh\nShort\n\n\nB\nMedium\nMedium\n\n\nC\nLow\nLong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Types of cardiovascular training (CVT) sessions.\n\n\n\n\nHigh intensity and short duration sessions\n\nThese tend to be relatively more taxing (compared to a low intensity session with the same activity) on connective tissue (i.e.¬†bones, joints, cartilage).\nThe main goal for such sessions is to stimulate adaptations for maximal power output, and faster recovery after bouts of maximal effort.\nThe duration and intensity of effort within a session can be selected to focus on different energy systems.\nThe anaerobic system is the primary responder for bouts of maximal effort that last up to 30 seconds.\nThe aerobic system is the primary responder for bouts of effort sustained for &gt; 1:00 minute.\nSuch sessions are aligned with the idea of interval training, e.g.¬†HIIT, Fartleks.\n\n\n\nMedium intensity and medium duration sessions\n\nThe idea is to exercise at as high an intensity that can be sustained for the entire workout duration.\nThe main goal for such sessions is to stimulate adaptations for sustained power output.\nThe level of lactate buildup (a byproduct of anaerobic breakdown of glucose within muscles) in the blood is a key indicator of such intensity.\nSuch sessions are commonly known as anaerobic threshold-, lactate threshold-, or tempo- workouts.\n\n\n\n\nAerobic threshold (AeT) and ventilatory threshold I (VTI) are equivalent terms. FATmax, Zone 1 (a.k.a. Zone 2!) workouts are other commonly used terms for this.\nAnaerobic threshold, Ventilatory threshold II (VTII), lactate threshold (LT) are also equivalent terms.\n\n\n\nLow intensity and long duration sessions\n\nThese are easier (relative to the fast and short sessions) on connective tissue.\nThe main goal for such sessions is to stimulate adaptations for efficiency and endurance of related systems.\nA key adaptation we seek through such sessions is increased utilization of fat as the energy substrate.\nThese sessions correspond to working out at or below aerobic threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples for different ability levels:\n\n\n\n\n\nüö∂üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è For a body that can walk for 30 mins without a break:\n\nCVT session A: 5-10 repeats of walking fast up an incline for 30 seconds to 1 minute, with 2-5 minutes rest intervals.\nCVT session B: 20-30 min of a fast walk.\nCVT session C: 1 hr of slow walking, take breaks as needed.\n\nüèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è For a body that is prepared enough to sustain a fast run e.g.¬†a 400-meter all-out effort:\n\nCVT session A: 5-10 repeats of 1 minute sprint-like maximal effort with 2-3 min rest intervals.\nCVT session B: 20-30 min of hard but steady effort.\nCVT session C: 1 hr of easy and steady effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise selection & frequency\n\nModify any activity e.g.¬†using a treadmill, stationary bike, rower, ski-erg, or being active outdoors to fit the intensity and duration pattern for CVT session A, B, or C. One can mix activities to manage fatigue in a particular system (e.g.¬†swimming for CVT session C would help manage fatigue in muscles and joints involved in running in CVT session A).\nCycling through sessions A, B, C over a span of 7-10 days at a time would be a good starting point. If this ends up inducing too much fatigue, reduce the effort level within sessions instead of cutting down on sessions, Figure¬†1.\nI recommend choosing a conservative starting point (let‚Äôs say 20% below current ability) and progressing over a few weeks to get close to actual ability.\nAs a rule of thumb, change just one of the training variables in a direction that increases challenge by a small amount (let‚Äôs say 5% per week - and even less if changing multiple variables simultaneously).\nRepeating the same activities for a month or more would make it easier to track progress, and fine-tune your subjective feeling of effort.\nI‚Äôd like to reiterate that these are not strict prescriptions, but serve as starting point to fine-tune as you spend time and gain experience.\n\nüìä My recommendations here fall somewhere between the pyramidal and threshold models. (Casado et al. 2022) review common ways of distributing training volume and intensity for CVT (pyramidal, threshold, polarized models) in runners, but the conceptual basis remains the same for any CVT-related activity."

    "section": "2 Resistance training (RT)",
    "text": "2 Resistance training (RT)\nExercises using dumbells, kettlebells, barbells, specialized machines, and bodyweight can all count towards resistance training (RT). Training variables commonly manipulated in resistance training include load, repetitions, sets, tempo, and rest intervals. Such variables can be adjusted to focus more on adaptations for hypertrophy, endurance, power, and strength. These are not entirely independent attributes. The different kinds of training stimuli lead to preferential but not exclusive development of these attributes.\n\nPath to learning exercises\n\nLearning any exercise involves acquisition, refinement or consolidation of motor skills (i.e.¬†motor learning).\nThis requires concentration and repetition (much like learning to play music on an instrument or a dance sequence).\nIf access to certain positions demanded by the exercise is not currently possible (i.e.¬†tightness, joint restrictions etc.), choose an exercise regression that you can load without discomfort.\nAim to learn a motor pattern that uses the intended muscle groups effectively and consolidate it within available ranges of movement.\nKeep working on end ranges with lower load till you can do progressed versions for that exercise.\nInvesting time to study anatomy and biomechanics underlying the movement patterns will help to adjust form and effectively stimulate the intended muscles.\n\n\n\nExercise selection and order\nA reasonable starting point is to pick one or two exercises for each of the following:\n\nSquat pattern\nHinge pattern\nVertical pull\nVertical push\nHorizontal pull\nHorizontal push\n\nRough reasoning:\n\nThese movement patterns cover a broad range of muscle groups.\nPrime mover (also known as agonist) muscle groups across these movements are largely non-overlapping.\nSo muscule fatigue from one exercise is less likely to interfere with another exercise that preferentially stimulates a different muscle group.\nThe ordering of exercise within a session is not too critical for a basic training plan; I personally prefer to do lower body exercises first (squats and hinge patterns here) to prioritise stimulating the bigger muscle groups while my nervous system feels more fresh.\n\n\n\nSets & Repetitions\nWork sets (i.e.¬†excluding any warmup sets) of any exercise within a given session follow one of the following patterns:\n\n(~3) sets with medium load and high (~10) repetition\n(~3) sets with high load and low (~5) repetitions\n\nThis holds for each exercise (and therefore for muscle groups used in that exercise). What qualifies as medium or high load depends on subjective ratings of effort (RPE, discussed below and Table¬†2).\nRough reasoning:\n\nMedium-load, high-repetition sessions tend to induce more fatigue, but are easier on joints.\nSuch sessions are throught to bias training towards stimulating hypertrophy.\nHigh-load, low-repetition sessions are harder on the joints.\nSuch sessions are throught to bias training towards strength adaptations.\n\n\n\nTempo\n\nSlowing the eccentric phase of the exercise in particular is thought to promote adaptations in related connective tissue (i.e.¬†tendons, ligaments, and cartilage).\nTempo is commonly indicated as time (in seconds) spent in the eccentric / pause / concentric / pause phases of the movement (e.g.¬†3/0/2/0).\nTraining with a focus on tempo, also commonly known as tempo training.\n\n\n\nLoad & Effort\n\nAn appropriate selection of load depends on the sets and repetitions scheme, the tempo at which the exercise is performed.\nTracking rated perceived exertion (RPE) and repetitions in reserve (RIR) can be used to select an appropriate initial load, see Table¬†2.\nHovering between 7-9 RPE or 2-5 RIR are typical guidelines (RIR may be easier to judge accurately for less experienced individuals).\nBackground stress / sleep / nutrition will also influence what loads correspond to a given RPE and RIR.\nLogging load on each exercise, and adjusting so that it trends upwards on a time scale of weeks is a common way (but clearly not the only way) to judge progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nRPE\nRIR\n\n\n\n\nLittle to no effort\n1-2\n-\n\n\nLight effort\n3-4\n-\n\n\nModerate\n5-6\n4-6\n\n\nHigh, vigorous\n6-7\n2-4\n\n\nVery hard\n8-9\n1\n\n\nMax. effort, nothing more left\n10\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†2: There is a rough equivalence between Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and Repetitions in reserve (RIR). Adapted from Helms et al. (2016).\n\n\n\n\n\nRest between sets\n\nThe goal of rest in between sets in RT is to allow adequate time for anaerobic systems to recover.\nToo much rest makes sessions unnecessarily long, too little rest prevents muscle fibers from operating at capacity across sets.\n2-5 minutes of rest between sets is a rough guideline for resistance training Freitas de Salles et al. (2009).\nNote that this is a recommendation for muscles used in a given exercise.\nSo to make workouts more efficient, one strategy is to alternate between exercises that don‚Äôt require the same muscle groups i.e.¬†supersets. Push and pull variations can generally be alternated this way.\nSupersetting becomes easier once the motor patterns are well-established for the exercises (i.e.¬†it does not interfere with technique)."

    "text": "3 Plyometric training (PT)\n\n\nPlyometric exercises are aimed at improvements in the re-use of elastic energy and the stretch reflex for movements that involve a stretch shortening cycle.\nA key feature of movements considered in plyometric training is that they are generally executed at fast time scales (e.g.¬†~200 ms or less).\nIf the same movement is performed slower, the passive elastic energy dissipates (e.g.¬†as heat), and the stretch reflex is not coordinated with the voluntary contraction for the desired movement.\nLower body movements: hopping, jumping, bounding, etc. and upper body movements: throwing, catching etc. are examples of plyometric exercises.\nPeak force, rate of force development, tolerance to impact etc. are key attributes we seek to improve through plyometric training.\nSuch exercises can be used to introduce graded and controlled exposure to impact (short duration, high force).\nThey can also be used to improve sport-specific athletic skills.\nHigh impact stimuli is thought to contribute to improvement/ maintenance of bone health.\nIt also is a way to recruit and maintain motor units that otherwise are only stimulated with heavy loads in RT.\n\n\nThe prescriptions for plyometric training are not as well-studied as for CVT and RT, (Davies, Riemann, and Manske 2015). However, the core principles of identifying training variables and systematically varying them to induce adaptations while avoiding overtraining remain the same.\n\nExercise selection\nIt is reasonable to include some version of hopping, bounding, throwing, and catching exercises at intensities that\n\ncan be tolerated (alongside RT and CVT sessions).\nare within available range of motion.\ncover a broad range of stimuli.\n\nA broad classification of exercises is helpful in this regard, and I personally like the one presented by (McInnes Watson 2024) (adapated here in Figure¬†2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Plyometric exercise classification: One can attempt to place exercises on this axis. For example, quick and light two-legged pogo hops would be in the bottom right quadrant. Depth-jump to box can be placed in the top left quadrant. Additional examples can be found in (McInnes Watson 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency, intensity\n\nLess intense versions of plyometric exercises (e.g.¬†two-leg pogo hops) can be performed in every RT or CVT session.\nMore intense versions can be performed once (per category, e.g.¬†trunk, lower body, upper body) every week.\nA rough starting point is 2-3 sets each with 20-40 rhythmic repetitions for low intensity exercises, and 2-3 sets of 5-10 repetitions for high intensity exercises.\nDo these at the beginning of workouts, when feeling fresh.\nDo these with intention and rhythm.\nDo not perform this until failure / fatigue."

    "text": "Parting thoughts\n\nFind exercise regressions that feel like a comfortable entry point, and then use it as a base to progress on by adding challenge through training variables (load, range of motion, tempo etc.).\nProgressing on the same exercise for a chunk of time (e.g.¬†2-3 months) is helpful to both, consolidate the movement pattern, and deliver an effective stimulus for physiological systems to adapt to.\nLearning and fine-tuning movement can take time. Moreover, good technique may not feel natural right away. Film yourself, share it with a qualified / trusted coach for feedback and recommendations to adjust movement patterns.\nKeep trying related variations (e.g.¬†different exercises, movement ranges, equipment etc.) separate from training, with no or low load. The goal of such exploration is to get a better feel for how movement combinations fit together.\nPerformance and fatigue accumulated within any given session depends on background stress / sleep / nutrition etc., so be kind to yourself and focus on consistency in practice over timescales of months and years.\n\nAs a crude engineering analogy, physical training helps to improve capacity, increase co-ordination, and ease bottlenecks in various systems:\n\nhardware (muscle fiber, connective tissue, bone etc.),\nsoftware (nervous system control),\nlocal fuel storage (intra-cellular stores),\nglobal fuel storage (adipose tissue, liver etc.)\npipelines for oxygen delivery, temperature control, and waste clearance (cardio-vascular system, lactate shuttle etc.).\n\nBuilding an understanding of these systems and their inter-dependence would be helpful to gain a more intuitive feel for physiological bottlenecks, desired adaptations, and their relationship to training variables.
