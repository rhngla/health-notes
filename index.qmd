Welcome! I'm an inter-disciplinary scientist at Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle. In my day job I build machine learning tools to understand organization principles of the mammalian brain. I have an undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics from IIT Bombay and a PhD in Physics from Northeastern University.

I became more interested in improving my own physical health and fitness at some point in 2022 ([more thoughts about my "why" here](https://substack.com/home/post/p-46208024)). I write this blog as a way to summarize my understanding, keep track of primary sources and interesting papers.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments. I'm also interested in writing collaborative blog posts - please reach out!
